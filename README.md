# Dockrized Rails App

This is a sample Rails application from [Docker for Rails Developers ](https://pragprog.com/book/ridocker/docker-for-rails-developers)(PragProg).
It was generated using Docker without Ruby installed on the local machine.
We're using the app to discover the wonderful world of Rails with Docker.
